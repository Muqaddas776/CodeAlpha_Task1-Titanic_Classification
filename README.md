# TITANIC CLASSIFICATION
One of the most well-known datasets in data science is the Titanic dataset. The dataset includes details on the passengers who boarded the Titanic in addition to additional data such as age, gender, success-socio-economic position, survivor status, and more.

As part of CodeAlpha's Data Science internship program, I created a model using this legendary dataset.My code cover the following area -

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data Visualization
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Feature Encoding
5. Model Building
6. Model Evaluation

I constructed the model using the Logistic Regression method. This model has an accuracy of 81%.

The first two files containing the data were "train.csv" and "test.csv". I created a model using the "train.csv" file and assessed it. Following that, I preprocess the "test.csv" file once more in order to feed them.
